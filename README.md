# 🌿 Plant Disease Detector

A deep learning-based tool for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. Upload a photo of a plant leaf and get an instant diagnosis using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model.

🌐 **Live App**: [https://thymosian-plant-disease-detector-streamlit-app-4xnfqg.streamlit.app/](https://thymosian-plant-disease-detector-streamlit-app-4xnfqg.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Model:** Fine-tuned ResNet18, trained on 15 plant disease classes.
- **Web App:** Streamlit interface for easy image upload and diagnosis.
- **CLI:** Command-line interface for batch or scripted predictions.
- **Unknown Detection:** Returns "Unknown or Uncertain" if the model is not confident.
- **Easy Deployment:** Run locally with minimal setup.

## ⚡ Quickstart

### 1. Install Requirements

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

```sh
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Use the CLI

```sh
python app.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- The model is loaded from [`model/plant_cnn.pt`](model/plant_cnn.pt) using [`load_model`](model/utils.py).
- Images are preprocessed to 224×224 pixels.
- [`predict_disease`](model/utils.py) returns the predicted class and confidence.
- If confidence < 75%, the result is "Unknown or Uncertain".

## 📝 Training

- See [`notebooks/01_train_model.ipynb`](notebooks/01_train_model.ipynb) for model training details.
- Data is organized in `data/processed/train`, `val`, and `test` folders.

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Add a true "Unknown" class with OOD (out-of-distribution) images.
- Improve generalization with more data augmentation.
- Implement advanced OOD detection methods (ODIN, Mahalanobis, OpenMax).
